# Provenance Radar

**An advanced investigation tool for identifying objects with potentially problematic ownership histories in museum collections**

Provenance Radar combines AI-powered risk assessment, network analysis, and timeline visualization to help researchers, curators, and investigators identify cultural heritage objects that may have been looted, stolen, or otherwise acquired through problematic means.

## üöÄ Features

### Core Investigation Tools
- **Risk Assessment Dashboard**: AI-powered scoring system that evaluates objects based on historical patterns, ownership gaps, and suspicious transaction indicators
- **Network Graph Visualization**: Interactive relationship mapping showing connections between objects, actors, places, and events with policy-aware edge coloring
- **Timeline Analysis**: Chronological visualization of provenance events with support for date ranges and source references
- **Geographic Mapping**: Location-based visualization showing the movement of objects through time and space
- **Evidence Sentences**: Full-text search through provenance documentation with AI similarity matching

### AI-Powered Analysis
- **Semantic Search**: Find similar objects and patterns using advanced embedding-based similarity search
- **AI Explanations**: Get detailed explanations of risk factors and suspicious patterns with text-to-speech playback
- **Pattern Detection**: Automatically identify common red flags like wartime sales, export restrictions, and ownership gaps

### Advanced Search & Filtering
- **Multi-source Search**: Search across multiple museum databases and collections
- **Risk-based Filtering**: Filter results by risk score thresholds and specific signal types
- **Source-specific Analysis**: Focus on particular institutions or collection sources
- **Real-time Statistics**: Live counts of objects, risk signals, and evidence sentences

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)
Built with modern web technologies for responsive, accessible investigation tools:

- **React 18** with TypeScript for type-safe component development
- **Tailwind CSS** with custom design system for consistent, professional UI
- **shadcn/ui** components for accessible, customizable interface elements
- **D3.js** for interactive network graphs and data visualizations
- **React Router** for seamless navigation between investigation views
- **Zustand** for efficient client-side state management

### Backend (Flask-Backend/)

The backend API is built with Flask and provides the core data processing and AI analysis capabilities:

```
Flask-Backend/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py              # Main Flask application and API endpoints
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile          # Container configuration for deployment
```

**Key API Endpoints:**
- `/api/health` - System health and database statistics
- `/api/leads` - Filtered list of high-risk objects
- `/api/object/:id` - Detailed object information with events and risks
- `/api/graph/:id` - Network relationships for visualization
- `/api/timeline/:id` - Chronological event data
- `/api/places/:id` - Geographic data for mapping
- `/api/similar` - Semantic similarity search
- `/api/explain/object/:id` - AI-generated risk explanations
- `/api/explain/text` - AI analysis of arbitrary text
- `/api/policy/windows` - Policy period definitions for compliance

**Technologies:**
- **Flask** web framework with CORS support
- **AI/ML Integration** for risk scoring and explanation generation
- **Vector Database** for semantic search capabilities
- **REST API** design following OpenAPI specifications

### Data Ingestion (TiDB-Ingest-Notebook/)

The ingestion system processes museum collection data and builds the knowledge graph:

```
TiDB-Ingest-Notebook/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ingest-tidb.ipynb    # Jupyter notebook for data processing and ingestion
```

**Processing Pipeline:**
1. **Data Collection**: Ingests museum collection records from multiple sources
2. **Entity Extraction**: Identifies people, places, organizations, and events
3. **Relationship Mapping**: Builds connections between entities based on provenance records
4. **Risk Scoring**: Applies AI models to assess ownership history problems
5. **Vector Embeddings**: Creates semantic representations for similarity search
6. **Database Population**: Stores processed data in TiDB with proper indexing

**Key Features:**
- Support for multiple museum data formats (CSV, JSON, XML)
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) for automatic entity extraction
- Temporal analysis for detecting suspicious ownership patterns
- Geographic coding of locations mentioned in provenance records
- Integration with external databases (Getty vocabularies, Wikidata, etc.)

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Python 3.9+ (for backend development)
- Docker (for containerized deployment)

### Frontend Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd provenance-radar

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set environment variables
echo "VITE_API_BASE=https://rairo-provenance-api.hf.space" > .env

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Backend Setup
```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd Flask-Backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run Flask development server
python main.py
```

### Data Ingestion Setup
```bash
# Install Jupyter and required packages
pip install jupyter pandas numpy sqlalchemy

# Launch notebook
cd TiDB-Ingest-Notebook
jupyter notebook ingest-tidb.ipynb
```

## üöÄ Deployment

### Frontend Deployment
The frontend is optimized for deployment on modern hosting platforms:

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

Deploy the `dist/` folder to any static hosting service (Vercel, Netlify, etc.).

### Backend Deployment
The Flask backend includes Docker support for containerized deployment:

```bash
# Build Docker image
cd Flask-Backend
docker build -t provenance-radar-api .

# Run container
docker run -p 5000:5000 provenance-radar-api
```
